# Day Planner

#### Purpose

The purpose of this project is learn to manipulate moment.js and capture the current time and change the past and future time accordingly. Same goes for minutes, seconds, months days, years. We can also add and subtract the current time to control the time in the future as well as the past and of course we can do the same for all other functions. This project also requires us to understand local storage as we need to implement it once the use click the save button on the side. All in all, we need make the site look exactly like the one shown in homework folder using HTML and CSS for styling of the page and Javascript to do everything else.

#### Functionality

The function of this project is to create a planner that allows users to add and update their tasks throughout the day. The planner consists of 9 hours time zone of the 24 hours period. There will be color coded for the current hour, previous (past) hour as well as next hour (future). The color coding consists of  3 different colors: 

```diff
# Gray - Past hours
- Red - Current hour
+ Green - Future hours
```

Users can also utulize the save button on the side as it will save all of their current as well as updated information.
